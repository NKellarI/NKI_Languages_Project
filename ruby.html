        General History:
        <p>
          Ruby's development started on February 24, 1993. On this day, Yukihiro
          Matsumoto changed the project's name; he suggested that it be dubed
          coral, though along with his colleague Keiju Ishitsuka, it was decided
          to be called Ruby. Like all languages, Ruby was designed to solve
          problems. Yukihiro or Matz wanted a simple object-oriented scripting
          language that would support features like iterators, execution
          handling, and garbage collection. After several versions and growing
          success, Matz was hired by netlab.jpa, an open source company, to be a
          full-time developer on Ruby. In 2000, Ruby became more popular than
          Pyhton in Japan. Though its popularity didn't explode until the
          release of Ruby on Rails, which was shipped with Mac OS X, Ruby on
          Rails is mainly used for web development, and as of 2023, it is still
          widely used for businesses.
        </p>
        Uses:
        <p>
          Ruby is mainly used for web development these days, as it has the
          ability to quickly develop applications and is clean and easy to
          understand. It is an interpreted language, and being object-oriented,
          its main programming architecture is to build out modules. Ruby is
          capable of desktop applications, static websites, data processing
          services, and automation tools. When you tack on Ruby on Rails, it
          becomes a powerful database-driven web application.
        </p>
        Current State:
        <p>
          Some people say that Ruby is dying, and to be clear, it still has
          significant value today. Ruby is still widely used in big companies.
          for example, Shopify, Coinbase, and GitLab. Ruby also makes money, as
          Ruby developers make a median of $90,000 a year. With its community, I
          believe Ruby will be sticking around for a while.
