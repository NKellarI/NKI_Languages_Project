            General History:
            <p>
                Rust, much like PHP, was started as a pet project, but its inception was a result of 22 flights of
                stairs and a broken elevator. Allow me to elaborate. Graydon Hoares apartment elevator software would
                often crash due to memory issues. This is because a large number of embedded systems use C or C++, and
                while extremely fast and compact, these languages lack memory safety. Though often a result of poor
                programming, this memory issue would cause Graydon's elevator to go out of order. With this newfound
                anger, he set out to build a language called Rust that was "Overengineered for Survival" in hopes of
                creating a low-level memory-safe language without sacrificing the benefits of C or C++. Mozzilla soon
                started sponsoring the development of rust, and after its release in 2010, it is one of the most loved
                languages today. It's even seen use in the linux kernel!!!
            </p>
            Uses:
            <p>
                Rust is a low-level programming language with incredible performance and strong memory security. It's a
                right hook to traditional system programming languages due to its memory-safe structure while still
                allowing the programmer to interface with hardware-level information. This is achieved by a borrower
                checker, which only allows each value to have one unique owner. Although this is an excessive
                oversimplification, it is here to give you an idea of how it works. This owner is responsible for
                releasing its own memory. This makes Rust useful for practically everything, ranging from web
                development to video games, operating systems, and even other languages. As a result of the memory
                security, it is increably secure as well.
            </p>
            Current State:
            <p>
                Rust is more popular today than it's ever been. According to the 2020 Developer Survey, Rust is also one
                of the most beloved languages to date, with 81% of respondents stating they are using it currently and
                enjoy it. That's roughly 52,000 people out of the 65,000 who answered.
