        General History:
        <p>
          C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and later
          approved as an international standard by Ecma in 2002 and ISO/IEC in
          2003. Microsoft included C# alogn with their flagship IDE Visual
          Studio and dotNet Framework. Later that year, a free and open-source
          version started being developed called Mono. A decade later, Visual
          Studio code is released, and Roslyn and the Unified Net Platerma were
          made, which supported C# completely free, open-source, and
          cross-platform.
        </p>
        Uses:
        <p>
            C# was originally intended to compete with Java. 
            Given the rapid surge in popularity and the favorable response from both new and experienced developers, 
            it's reasonable to say that aim has been met.
            C# was created by Microsoft for Microsoft, so 
            it's no surprise that it's most widely used for creating 
            Windows desktop apps. Because C# applications require the Windows.NET 
            framework to function effectively, the ideal use case for this language 
            is designing apps and programs that are specific to the 
            Microsoft platform's architecture. C# is possibly one of the 
            best programming languages for game creation. This language is 
            frequently utilized on the Unity Game Engine to generate fan-favorite 
            games such as Rimworld.In case you didn't already know, Unity is by far the most popular.
            C# is commonly used to construct professional, 
            dynamic websites as well as open-source software on the.NET 
            platform. Even if you despise Microsoft's architecture, 
            C# may be used to create a fully functional website. 
            This language is widely used to construct websites that are 
            incredibly efficient, easily scalable, and simple to manage due 
            to its object-oriented nature.
            Fun Fact: VSCode is a web app written in C#!
        </p>
        Current State:
        <p>
            C# programmers are in high demand. 
            C# skills are in high demand, and both 
            large and small firms use C# on a daily basis 
            to construct vital systems. There are plenty of 
            C# developer positions available around the world, 
            therefore learning C# is a safe bet for your future
             career. According to popular belief, C# was designed 
             to be a clone of Java. However, beginning with version 2.0, C#
              progressed in a new and far faster direction. Lambda 
              expressions, for example, were years ahead of Java.
