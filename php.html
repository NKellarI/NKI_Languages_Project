            General History:
            <p>
                <strong>Rasmus</strong> Lerdorf began PHP as a side project with the intention of tracking who was looking at his resume.
                The initial version, dubbed personal home page tools, was made available to the general public in early
                1995. It was composed of several utilities and a simple parser that could understand some macros. Midway
                through 1995, Rasmus remade the parser and called it PHP/FI. He then added a number of features,
                including support for mSQL, a form interpreter, and basic webpage tools, and suddenly, like magic, a
                quickly expanding language was born. With the explosive success of PHP in 1997, development evolved from
                just a pet project to an organized team effort. PHP still receives updates to this day.

            Uses:
            <p>
                PHP (Hypertext PreProcessor) is a massive open-source scripting language that has cemented its place in
                internet history.
                Its main strength is server-side scripting, which can allow you to make customized interfaces and almost
                anything you can think of.
                Essentially, it transforms your static website into a wickedly cool, dynamic one.
                It's also cross-platform, pretty simplistic, and reasonably fast!
            </p>
            Current State:
            <p>
                While PHP might be considered neolithic to many,
                it's still massive on the modern web, as data shows that around 77.4% of websites still use it,
                which is insane considering it came out in 1995!
                Though with the amount of choices now it has seen some decline.
